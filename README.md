# Project "ICOS data and modeling at Col du Lautaret"

As carbon dioxide (CO~2~) concentration into the amosphere is increasing, causing global warming, it becomes essential to mitigate the negative impacts of this phenomenon. Acting as natural carbon sinks, grasslands sequester up to 300 kg of carbon per hectare per year. However, their role and long-term sustainability could be threatened by climate change, especially in the Alps where the global warming is occurring faster than elsewhere. To understand the exchanges of CO~2~ and H~2~O between the ecosystem and the atmosphere, the IGE (Institute of Environmental Geosciences) supervises an ICOS-associated flux tower at Col du Lautaret (France). Installed on an alpine grassland characterized by varied plant species and topography, the main problematic is: **to what extent are the datatsets representative of the different elements and fluxes in the landscape ?**

## Objectives

The goals of this work are:
    - **To characterize the fluxes origin depending on different periods**
    - **To determine the contribution of certain areas (road, wetland, ...) to the measured CO~2~**
    - **To facilitate the comparison with other models, in particular hydrological**

## Usage 

### 1. Data importation
### 2. Data preparation
### 3. Isolate certain periods
### 4. Calculate footprints with contours from 10 to 90%
### 5. Plot the footprint
### 6. Reproject the footprint onto another grid
### 7. Save in daily netCDF files for further work
